Pocket-Scorecard by John Brewer

This is a project to create a full featured baseball scorecard that is compact enough to fit in your pocket.

This project uses ideas from two other projects:

	1. PocketMod http://pocketmod.com/
	2. Reisner Scorebooks http://www.reisnerscorekeeping.com/

Folding instructions can be found online: http://pocketmod.com/design/inst.jpg

The scorecard will work with a variety of scorekeeping methods, but works best using the Reisner Scorekeeping system. Instructions on how to use the Reisner system can be found online: http://alexreisner.com/baseball/docs/ReisnerScorekeepingDocumentation.pdf
