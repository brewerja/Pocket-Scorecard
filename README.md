# Pocket-Scorecard by John Brewer

This is a project to create a full featured baseball scorecard that is compact enough to fit in your pocket.

This project uses ideas from two other projects:

1. [PocketMod](https://pocketmod.com/howto)
2. [Reisner Scorekeeping](http://www.reisnerscorekeeping.com/how)

The scorecard will work with a variety of scorekeeping methods, but works best using the Reisner Scorekeeping system.

For printing, ensure that the printer does not scale the file and prints at 100%. The card is oriented so that lines outside the printable area of whatever printer you are using are less important. For best results, take care when folding.

Requires a working Tex installation and Python 3.
